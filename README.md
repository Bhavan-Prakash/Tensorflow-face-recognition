# Face Recognition Using TensorFlow Lite

## Overview
This project implements real-time face recognition using a TensorFlow Lite-based model for efficient, on-device processing. It ensures low latency and high accuracy while running seamlessly on both Android and iOS platforms. The frontend is developed using React Native, leveraging HTML, JavaScript, and React.js to provide a responsive and consistent user experience across devices.

## Features
- **On-Device Face Recognition**: Uses TensorFlow Lite for fast and efficient processing without relying on cloud services.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on both Android and iOS devices.
- **Optimized Performance**: Low-latency face detection with high accuracy.
- **React Native Frontend**: Provides an interactive and mobile-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React Native (HTML, JavaScript, React.js)
- **Backend**: TensorFlow Lite (for on-device face recognition)
